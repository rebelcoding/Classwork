	<b> I was raised by a family that voted for Trump. And when you look like this (i.e. brown), that has consequences. I also received an extra-ordinary education; but I have not finished college. This is not to say that I have not had significant successes in my life; though the difficulties are more evident it would seem. I arrive at your door, because I want to learn how to build JS websites, and I want help getting a job. To me, $15,000 is worth being able to get a job that will start out paying me $50,000. While I have all the requisite skills to be very successful in this field. And it hasn't been until now that our culture has been ready to give an individual such as myself a equal opportunity such as this.</b>

	<p id="profile">I was instructed that I was supposed to go to college after high school; that's what was expected of me, so I gave a go at it. I got distracted and had a child, so, oops. I returned to the University many years later in an attempt to finish. Well, actually I couldn't get a job that paid me enough to live, so I thought I'd take out a few loans and try my hand at that again. I never took out any private loans, thank god; but the experience was as I've always remembered school. I'm usually the only person of color in the room.</p>
	<p id="profile">I was able to wrangle a job out of the experience, for a time, until my fortuitiousness as a guinea pig ran out. None the less, I was able to form many positive relationships, and obtain informative experiences. I'm about 4 classes from completing my degree, but financial impairment constrains me.</p>

	<h2>Orono High School</h2>
	<h3>You ever play Duck Duck Brown Duck?</h3>
	
	<p id="profile">I was one of five student of color in my graduating class. In kindergarden we use to play "duck duck brown duck." It was a traumatic experience to say the least. But I learned how to read, write, and do my arithmetics. And I was also taught how to think critically by the few teachers to dared to invest their time in me. From physics to history, I was a passionate student. Truly these experiences have made me who I am today.</p>

	<p>From GiantSteps to MakeItMSP, from the State Capital to Minneapolis' Fourth Precinct, I've been involved in the Minneapolis, and Minnesota Community. Everyone seems to appreciate my input, but converting this to a viable, healthy, job opportunity; this is why I approach Prime Academy. I want to capitalize on my network, but I need the credibility mentorship through Prime can give me.</p>

	<p>Presently I sit on the Public Policy board for the MetroIBA</p>

	<p>Casey from Software for Good as well as Jay Haas from Clockwork, are helping me develop MnActivist; slowly but surely.</p>

	<p>I've started building a conversation with Andrew Wittenborg of the Minnesota High Tech Association.</p>

	<p>I approached Nancy Lyons years ago at a Giantsteps conference, and have been surprising her ever since.</p>

	<p>People know of me, but few actually know me. Sadly this is the product of a culturally broken and disconnected society. I would like to help this, but need help myself. This is why I seek entrance to Prime Academy and the doors it can help open for me.</p>

		  MnActivist is a project that I began about 18 months ago out of a desire to both learn how to scrape data and aggregate municipal calenders. It has grown slowly, and while I'm not currently running the scripts; it has the capacity gather data for Minneapolis, St Paul, Ramsey County, Minnesota Legislature, and more. I'm presently working recreationally with two mentors to both upgrade the platform to implement a Wordpress front-end, as well as with another local-notable to focus to service it provides, and to whom.

I also helped get a website up for him, and working with others push his career forward.

Solving that type of problem is incredibly fun for me.</p>
	    <p>Sadly as the job wore on, it was made apparent that I would not be compensated commensurately for my work; while my output only continued to expand. I built a platform upon which to aggregate their data, and create valuable vizualizations that included mapping and aggregating external data. I independently built tools for the other departments to optimize their workload. It was a wonderful learning experience, and fortified, for me, that tech was the field in which I needed to be.</p>

	      I had been playing with Django for sometime. I was encouraged to learn Python from a friend, and my interest was in building a CMS. This was an entry-level opportunity that developed into learning about the full-stack of an application.

	      Ansible

	      There were three applications that needed to roped into one script for easy deployment. The task was on me to figure out how thi was done. And it got done. Ansible is a fascinating tool.

	      Bootstrap & JS
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
	      After getting my feet wet, I was tossed into the deep-end and was challenged to built a interactive toolset for tracking student metrics. Both BootStrap & jQuery were heavily relied upon to make the interactivity smooth and accessible to rudimentary users. I did not know much jQuery when I started the project, but I was able to learn how the DOM works by the end of it.

	  <p>After hanging around the Python Meetup group, and job opportunity was posted. I applied, but was not hired until they learned they would need more hands on deck. It was an incredible introduction to a CMS (Django) that I continue to build with today. Sadly, the money came in too fast, and my advice was not heeded. As a junior developer, my position became over-shadowed by my manager's friend who was eventually hired, and the support necessary became unavailable amidst the bro-culture that developed. I was forced to leave.</p>
