    "## If-Else Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "If-Else statements are one of the first steps to allowing our programs to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "varx = True\n",
    "\n",
    "if varx == True:\n",
    "    print('Variable X is True')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Variable X is not True')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is *very* important to make note of the spacing here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both *If-Else* statements and *Functions* use indentation has a way to identify the various parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically code will be indented either two or four spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) the Python Style Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "> The *PEP 8* guidelines are an excellent resource to read through once, simply for awareness!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice how we *ask* our *if* question with the double equals sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a single equals sign set a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A double equals sign affirms that two objects have the *same value*; which is not the same as being the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "[More Notes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15008380/double-equals-vs-is-in-python)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In JavaScript there is a triple equals sign, to check if two variables have the same value and are the same type! Which again, is not the same as being the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a larger to be discussed here, though perhaps it concerns JavaScript a bit more. And that is whether a variable is an object, or a representation of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenevery anything is written by a computer, binary code is changed at byte-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a variable `varx = 3`, that piece of information is written into bytes and stored at a specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things can happen from here: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) this piece of code can be changed. `varx = 5`\n",
    "\n",
    "2) the code can be referenced, and the reference changed. `varz = varx + 5`\n",
    "\n",
    "I am simply adding this reference here as an extra nugget of info for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are more at play when using JavaScript than in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If-ElseIf-Else\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary option of only *if* or *else* is simply not tenable for application in isolation; we need to be able to have more options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the *ElseIf* or *elif* option!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "varx = 'green'\n",
    "\n",
    "if varx == 'yellow':\n",
    "    print('Variable X is Yellow')\n",
    "elif varx == 'blue':\n",
    "    print('Variable X is Blue')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Variable X is neither Yellow nor Blue')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have changed Variable X to use a string instead of Boolean statement, and the *else* statement serves are our 'catch-all' reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is a best practice to make sure we always conclude our statements and functions with some indication of the resolution taken by the code.\n",
