    "\n",
    "The words that I have italicized are worth remembering as concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have an `<html>` tag that contains two other tags, `<head>` and `<body>`. \n",

    "Each of these contain yet another tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, there is some text.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view this page in action [here](//screamfreely.github.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "So besides everything, what else are we missing??\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS for one ...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cascading Style Scripts** are *scripts that style our code*; we'll explain the cascading part in a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I want to change the color of an item, I would use CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to use CSS, and almost like JavaScript, the number of CSS libraries seems to always be growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, the basics are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inline\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we add the styling code directly within the tag to which it is to be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "We add a *style* property to the tag, and then include our preferred augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Home</title>\n",

    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Embedded\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes CSS nifty, is that you can use it to make adjustments to whole groups or types of tags!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of including a *style* property on the `<h1>` tag, we use the `<style>` tag ~ in this tag we are able to list the tags we want to affect, and define our preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Home</title>\n",

    "#### Embedded + Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like before, but now we are going to take a look at classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you don't want to affect every `<h1>` tag?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use classes! Classes are heavily used in CSS and styling libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *class* property does allow for more than parameter, separated by a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",

    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Home</title>\n",

    "#### Imported\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we imagine that for an entire application there is going to be a whole heap of CSS code. And having it all in the same file as the base file will be ridiculous!\n",
    "\n",
    "Entonces, we are going to write a completely separate file, and *import* it into our base file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this using a `<link>` tag, that contains two properties, *rel* and *href*. *rel* defines the relationship of the file being consumed; and *href* provides the address at which the file can be found, *hyperlink-reference*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",

    "\n",
    "**Cascading** refers to how instructions are interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the *style.css* scripts says `<h1>` tags should all be green, but a style property on the page specifies that this specific `<h1>` tag should be blue??\n",
    "\n",
    "*Most of the time* the page, or component, specific parameter/property/attribute will take precedence in styling the tag. And this is attributed to the cascading nature of style scripts :)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our three takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1) Open and close tags\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't talk about it, but notice how *every* tag gets closed with a `</>` type tag?\n",
    "\n",
    "An important concept to remember is that whenever we open a tag, or function, and we need to make sure to *close* it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some instances that will mean returning a value, or simply using a semi-colon, `;`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will get a bug in your code at least once or twice, because some parameter has not effectively been *closed*.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2) Importing scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of our code is going to be in one file.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is just not reasonable!\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing code from other files is the answer ~ \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to do this, we saw one-way to import another file in HTML. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3) Nested properties\n",
    "Ok, I am cheating here and combining to ideas into one \n",
    "\n",
    "Tags have properties, parameters have properties. This concept will be expanded upon in JavaScript and Python, when we learn that properties can have properties, which have properties, that can also have properties which ... you get the picture ...\n",
    "\n",
    "And these things can be, and are, *nested* within each other --- which relates to the importance of *closing* our parameter, functions and other mechanics, properly. \n",

    "In JS5 this all means, when the our DOM object is clicked, *on-click*, the following function should happen.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Acting\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this function we declare and define a variable calling it *target*, and set this variable using our dollar-sign, while specifying a specific propery attribute to read, *rel*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use this property attribute value to identify a third object. \n",

    "# Basic Coding Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are about to enter the world of coding; \n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is where were web development first began the crossover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using JavaScript all of the following concepts can be accomplished.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are a way of storing information, and using it elsewhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "And so there are various types of variables, *strings*, *lists*, and *dictionaries* to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are a collection of characters enclosed by quotations, single or double, it matters not which.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var target = 'some string';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean values are *true/false* values; one or the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is translated into machine code as either a `0` or `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var target = true;\n",
    "# or\n",
    "var target = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a collection of objects separated by commas and enclosed by brackets `[]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lists start at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objects do not all need to be of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var target = ['some', 'list', 'of', 'strings', ['with another list', 'within',], true,];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dicionatires are a collection of *key-value pairs*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break that down, the *key* is defined by a string, and separated from the *value* by a colon `:`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each *key/value pair* is then separated by comma `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all enclosed within *curly brackets* `{}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var target = {'text': 'some string', 'published': false, 'colors': ['red', 'blue',],};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If-statements\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "if (x < y) {\n",
    "  var display = \"Welcome to SF Coding 101\";\n",
    "} else if (x < z) {\n",
    "  var display = \"Welcome to SF Coding 102\";\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "  var display = \"We haven't planned this far ahead yet :/ Check with class mates to see how they are, porfa\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Read it out-loud:\n",
    "\n",
    "If *x* is *less than y*, the variable *display* equals a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Else, if x* is not less than *y* and is *less than z*, *display* equals a different string.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *x* is larger than them all, using the *else* statement, *display* is set to equal a third string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For loops\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "for (var i = 0; i < 9; i++) {\n",
    " console.log(i);\n",
    " // more statements\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Read it out:\n",
    "\n",
    "For *variable i* that equals zero, when *i* is less than 9, *i*++. *Console.log(i);* ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.log() prints out what ever is contained in the parenthesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript the shortened version to increment a value by 1 is *++*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Search for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are where is all comes together, in a sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to define an object that consumes other objects, and uses them to create an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var blump = function(prop1, prop2){\n",
    "                var a = prop1\n",
    "                var b = prop2\n",
    "                var c = a/b\n",
    "            return c\n",
    "            };\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's read this out-loud:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable *blump* is a function that consumes/uses two objects, *prop1* and *prop2*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within our function these two objects are made into variables *a* and *b*, which are then used to create a third variable *c*. \n",
    "\n",
