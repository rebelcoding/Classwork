    "# HTML & CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML is the basic framing for webpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyper Text Markup Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to introduce three basic takeaways that you can apply to EVERY computer language:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Open and close tags\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Importing scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Nested properties\n",
    "\n",
    "> Even though *most* websites use technologies beyond HTML, the information is often presented through HTML, or a similarly structured frame (sidequest: XML)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting with HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example containing, practically, the least amount of code needed to display a webpage using HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Home</title>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <h1>Welcome to SF</h1>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! \n",
    "\n",
    "Granted ... all the webpage has is a headline that says \"Welcome to SF\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have are a collection of *tags*, which are *nested* within each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `<html>` tag that contains two other tags, `<head>` and `<body>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "And each of these contain yet another tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is some text.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view this page in action [here](//screamfreely.github.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "So besides everything, what else are we missing??\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS for one ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cascading Style Scripts** are *scripts that style our code*; we'll explain the cascading part in a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I want to change the color of an item, I would use CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to use CSS, and almost like JavaScript, the number of CSS libraries seems to always be growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, the basics are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inline\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we add the styling code directly within the tag to which it is to be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "We add a *style* property to the tag, and then include our preferred augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Home</title>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <h1 style=\"color: #42FD23; font-size: 5em;\">Welcome to SF</h1>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Embedded\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes CSS nifty, is that you can use it to make adjustments to whole groups or types of tags!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of including a *style* property on the `<h1>` tag, we use the `<style>` tag ~ in this tag we are able to list the tags we want to affect, and define our preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Home</title>\n",
    "        <style>\n",
    "            h1 {\n",
    "                color: #42FD23;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        </style>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <h1>Welcome to SF</h1>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Embedded + Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like before, but now we are going to take a look at classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you don't want to affect every `<h1>` tag?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use classes! Classes are heavily used in CSS and styling libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *class* property does allow for more than parameter, separated by a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Home</title>\n",
    "        <style>\n",
    "            h1 {\n",
    "                color: #42FD23;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "            .headline {\n",
    "                text-decoration: underline;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        </style>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <h1 class=\"headline other-class\">Welcome to SF</h1>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imported\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we imagine that for an entire application there is going to be a whole heap of CSS code. And having it all in the same file as the base file will be ridiculous!\n",
    "\n",
    "Entonces, we are going to write a completely separate file, and *import* it into our base file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this using a `<link>` tag, that contains two properties, *rel* and *href*. *rel* defines the relationship of the file being consumed; and *href* provides the address at which the file can be found, *hyperlink-reference*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Home</title>\n",
    "        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\"/>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <h1>Welcome to SF</h1>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cascading** refers to how instructions are interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the *style.css* scripts says `<h1>` tags should all be green, but a style property on the page specifies that this specific `<h1>` tag should be blue??\n",
    "\n",
    "*Most of the time* the page, or component, specific parameter/property/attribute will take precedence in styling the tag. And this is attributed to the cascading nature of style scripts :)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our three takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1) Open and close tags\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't talk about it, but notice how *every* tag gets closed with a `</>` type tag?\n",
    "\n",
    "An important concept to remember is that whenever we open a tag, or function, and we need to make sure to *close* it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some instances that will mean returning a value, or simply using a semi-colon, `;`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will get a bug in your code at least once or twice, because some parameter has not effectively been *closed*.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2) Importing scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of our code is going to be in one file.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is just not reasonable!\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing code from other files is the answer ~ \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to do this, we saw one-way to import another file in HTML. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3) Nested properties\n",
    "Ok, I am cheating here and combining to ideas into one \n",
    "\n",
    "Tags have properties, parameters have properties. This concept will be expanded upon in JavaScript and Python, when we learn that properties can have properties, which have properties, that can also have properties which ... you get the picture ...\n",
    "\n",
    "And these things can be, and are, *nested* within each other --- which relates to the importance of *closing* our parameter, functions and other mechanics, properly. \n",
    "\n",
