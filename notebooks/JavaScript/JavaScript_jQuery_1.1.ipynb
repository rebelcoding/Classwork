    "## Basic Coding Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to do a quick overview of basic coding structures using JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we will go over these structures in more detail using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are a way of storing information, and using it elsewhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "And so there are various types of variables, *strings*, *lists*, and *dictionaries* to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are a collection of characters enclosed by quotations, single or double, it matters not which.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript \n",
    "var item = 'some string';\n",
    "let item3 = 'some other string';\n",
    "const newItem = 'new string';\n",
    "```\n",
    "JavaScript recently made a significant leap in structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two lines, using `var` and `let`, have the same meaning. Each set a variable that can later be changed, or is *mutable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opposingly, `const` sets a variable that *can not* be changed, or is *immutable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean values are *true/false* values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translated into machine code, values are either a `0` or `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var target = true;\n",
    "# or\n",
    "var target = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that in JavaScript the `true` or `false` values is spelled with a lower-case first-letter; this too is specific to JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a collection of objects separated by commas and enclosed by brackets `[]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objects do not all need to be of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let newList = ['some', 'list', 'of', 'strings', ['with another list', 'within',], true,];\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, one may wish to obtain an object by its position in a list, or an operation of similar effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would mean, to obtain objects by their list index number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both JavaScript and Python, lists begin at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iin our example `newList` from above, if I wanted to get the first object in the list I would use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let specificItem = newList[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we are not using quotations around this number, and that it is placed with square-brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you get the second item of the list within our example list?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dicionatires are a collection of *key-value pairs*. And in JavaScript, they are called *objects*.\n",
    "\n",
    "And everything in JavaScript is an object, seems kinda weird to think about right now -- so just toss the idea into the back of your noggin' and we'll keep rollin'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var target = {'text': 'some string', 'published': false, 'colors': ['red', 'blue',],};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's break this down, the *key* is defined by a string, and separated from the *value* by a colon `:`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each *key/value pair* is then separated by comma `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all enclosed within *curly brackets* `{}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is a dictionary in coding terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If-statements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "if (x < y) {\n",
    "  var display = \"Welcome to SF Coding 101\";\n",
    "} else if (x < z) {\n",
    "  var display = \"Welcome to SF Coding 102\";\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "  var display = \"We haven't planned this far ahead yet :/ Check with class mates to see how they are, porfa\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Read it out-loud:\n",
    "\n",
    "If *x* is *less than y*, the variable *display* equals a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Else, if x* is not less than *y* and is *less than z*, *display* equals a different string.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *x* is larger than them all, using the *else* statement, *display* is set to equal a third string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For loops\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "for (var i = 0; i < 9; i++) {\n",
    " console.log(i);\n",
    " // more statements\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Read it out:\n",
    "\n",
    "For *variable i* that equals zero, when *i* is less than 9, *i*++. *Console.log(i);* ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Console.log() prints out what ever is contained in the parenthesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript the shortened version to increment a value by 1 is *++*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Search for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are where is all comes together, in a sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to define an object that consumes other objects, and uses them to create an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var blump = function(prop1, prop2){\n",
    "                var a = prop1\n",
    "                var b = prop2\n",
    "                var c = a/b\n",
    "            return c\n",
    "            };\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's read this out-loud:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable *blump* is a function that consumes/uses two objects, *prop1* and *prop2*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within our function these two objects are made into variables *a* and *b*, which are then used to create a third variable *c*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This last variable *c* is then returned by our function. "

    "## jQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen with CSS that we can modify the aesthetics of our webpages. Be this by adding colors, augmenting shapes, and other modifications. But what if you could \"automate that\"? How would you do such a thing?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to *hook into* the HTML structure, or the DOM, Document Object Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the dollar-sign, which is specific to jQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<script src=\"bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\n",
    "<script src=\"jquery.min.js\"></script>\n",
    "\n",
    "<script>\n",
    "$(\".jobLabel a\").on(\"click\", function(){\n",
    "\n",
    "    var target = $(this).attr(\"rel\");\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $(\"#\"+target).show().siblings(\"div\").hide();   \n",
    "});\n",
    "</script>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a complex-looking function, so let's disassemble it and see what's going on:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The $\n",
    "\n",
    "The dollar-sign allows us to access the DOM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once inside the DOM, we can identify specific elements and change them!\n",
    "\n",
    "Parenthesis contain things (*duh*), and contained in these first parethesis are set of items separated by a space, *.jobLabel* and *a*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recognize the syntax of *.jobLabel* from CSS, and determine that it indicates a class, while the *a* is an html tag!\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1) We have identified a specific set of objects on the webpage/DOM with which to work!\n",
    "\n",
    "> `$('.jobLabel a')` which means all of the `a` tags with the class 'jobLabel'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Interactivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the object discerned, what is happening with it?!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a period after our parenthetical statement, followed by the word *on*, and another set of parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are \"chain linking\" operations, with the use of a period.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2) We have an action, or set of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `.on('click',function(){});` \n",
    "\n",
    "To translate, what we have so far `$('.jobLabel a').on('click', function(){});`:\n",
    "\n",
    "For all `a` tags with the class \"jobLabel\" ... when the element is clicked perform the following function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Acting\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "    var target = $(this).attr(\"rel\");\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $(\"#\"+target).show().siblings(\"div\").hide();\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this function we declare and define a variable and call it *target*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we set this variable using our dollar-sign, while specifying a specific propery attribute to read, *rel*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attribute value is then used to identify a third object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have our action.\n",
    "\n",
    "To *show* our selected item, while *hiding* all of its *siblings*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3) Within the function we are able to affect,and change, the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `var target = $(this).attr('rel');`\n",
    "    \n",
    "> `$(\"#\"+target).show().siblings(\"div\").hide();`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how each line ends with a semi-colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "And how each parenthetical statement, or bracketed statement, is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I want us to notice the use of `show()` and `hide()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While other parenthesis have items within them, these parenthesis are left empty ...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance the parenthesis are identifying a function that is to be performed, and requires no parameters."
