    "# Basic Git Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will cover how to use basic `git` commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git` is a system for version-control. What this means is that it keeps a record of our files, and the changes we make to them. Should we ever need to re-examine a change, `git` has ways of letting us do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `git clone`\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to get a repository, and presuming you have an `ssh` registered with a Github account, we can use the command `git clone git@github.com:ScreamFreely/SFCodingClass`\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's take a close look at what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git` this is the program we are running\n",
    "\n",
    "`clone` is the command we are running within the `git` program\n",
    "\n",
    "`git@github.com` the `clone` command requires certain parameters, this first one tells the `git` program what domain will be used to used.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ScreamFreely` once we have the correct domain, we need to identify the correct user, which in this case is `ScreamFreely`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SFCodingClass` and lastly, we need to identify the correct repository we want to clone onto our server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our structure then is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone git@github.com:user/repository`\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to include the `:` and `/` symbols correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your `ssh` key-pair is correctly set up, you ought see the following when you run the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "newuser@sf-codes:~$ git clone git@github.com:ScreamFreely/SFCodingClass\n",
    "Cloning into 'SFCodingClass'...\n",

    "\n",
    "First we will navigate into the correct directory using `cd SFCodingClass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will use the command `git add .` to add all of the files from that location *on down the system* that have changed since the code was last ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to add a specific file we could use the command like this:\n",
