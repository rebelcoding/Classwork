    "# Basic Bash Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we cover basic bash commands with introductory details.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### `whoami` & `pwd`\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first to commands are basic *who am I* and *where am I*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitely things you want to know when you're messing around on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "`whoami` get the name of the user and see that name returned in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "newuser@sf-codes:~$ whoami\n",
    "newuser\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`pwd` tells us our *present working directory*, or where in the system we are currently located.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually after signing into a system you will be directed to the user's home directory, that is the case in our hypothetical system\n",
    "\n",
    "The terminal returns `/home/newuser` when `pwd` is entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "newuser@sf-codes:~$ pwd\n",
    "/home/newuser\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "---\n",
    "### `ls`\n",
    "Our next question is *what* is around us in our `pwd`?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we use the `ls` command to list the items in a directory\n",
    "\n",
    "On our system there is only one item in our home directy, and `notebooks` is returned when we input the command `1s`\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "newuser@sf-codes:~$ ls \n",
    "canin@sf-codes:~$ ls\n",

    "### `cd`\n",
    "\n",
    "*How* do we get into that directory?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the command `cd` change directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice what changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems can be setup differently though often enough it will have some variation of the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "`user` @ `system-hostname`: `pwd` $\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `$` commands are seen when input.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we changed directories our `pwd` directory changed from `~` to `~/notebooks`\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "---\n",
    "### Command flags\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know the `ls` command to list the items in a directory, but we only got the names of the items and no details!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's augment our `ls` command with the use of a *flag*, and in this case we will use the `l` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our commnd will look like this: `ls -l`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how a `-` is used to signify our flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this flag we are shown the details of the files in our designated directory.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For this we will augment our `cp` command with the `r` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that `r` stands for recursive, which means that whatever is being copied, everything within that will be copied as well, as well as everything within that next level, and so on.\n",
